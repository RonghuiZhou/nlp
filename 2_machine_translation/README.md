# Introduction

This notebook is a project in the Udacity NLP nanodegree program. In
this notebook, we build a deep neural network that functions as part
of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline
will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently.
